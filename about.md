Besides being a technologist, I am an amateur long distance runner, mostly trail runs and marathons. As of April 2007, I have completed 13 marathons in 8 states with my best time being a 2:58:30 in the Mohawk-Hudson Marathon last year. Lots of people ask me how I can stand going for twenty mile runs. But actually, its on those runs that I find my best ideas come to me. It is the one time that I can hours alone just to think. It is amazing what comes in to your head when the blood and adrenaline are pumping.
