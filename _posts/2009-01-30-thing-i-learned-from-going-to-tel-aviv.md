Earlier this month I had the opportunity to [travel](http://picasaweb.google.com/robdimarco/IsraelTrip#) to [Tel Aviv](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=tel+aviv&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&split=0&gl=us&ll=32.095809,34.774808&spn=0.006844,0.012156&t=h&z=17) to work with [my development team there](http://sergata.com/).&nbsp; This trip was fascinating for me, both personally and professionally, and I learned a bunch of lessons.

## #1 Development Process Risk Mitigation

Spending $3-5k for travel will not kill a project, but bad communication can&#8230;&nbsp; Going to Israel, our plan was to have a "mini-project", ship something in the week I was there.&nbsp; Day 1 involved project planning with a goal of shipping Day 5.&nbsp; Going through this process showed me what holes we had in communicating with each other.&nbsp; By communicating, I don&#8217;t just mean language issues, I mean effectively explaining what needed to be done to plan, develop, and ship the project.&nbsp; If we have problems when we are in the same room, we are definitely going to have problems when we are separated distance and time zones.&nbsp; In my week there, we did not ship on time.&nbsp; I learned that we had a problem being overly optimistic in some of our estimating techniques.&nbsp; To me, it showed that some of our slippages in the past were not as much due to the outsourcing model, rather to poor project planning techniques.&nbsp; At the end of the week, it was my conclusion that either I (or my other team lead) that we really needed to change certain parts of the process to be better at planning and execution of our development interactions.

## #2 More People Should Visit

The country was beautiful.&nbsp; I was turned off a little by the architecture in Tel Aviv at the beginning of my trip, but by the end, I found it to be quite beautiful, especially the older parts of Tel Aviv.&nbsp; Also, it was awesome to be on the beach in shorts in January, reminded me a little of California.

## #3 There Will Never Be Peace

One thing that is missing in most American news analysis, the conflicts around Israel are not as simple as Israel vs. Palestine.&nbsp; There are so many conflicts, between the secular and the religious, between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs, between people of Eastern European/Russian lineage and other groups, between recent immigrants and those that have been there longer, between Fatah and Hamas, the list goes on.&nbsp; There is no where near a unified front on how the ending should look and people are militant about it on all sides.&nbsp; The conflict is so much deeper than just us vs. them; I don&#8217;t see how the people (especially in Jerusalem) will ever agree on zoning laws, let alone bigger issues.

## #4 An International Midge of Mystery

Christina (my wife, aka Midge) came with me on the trip and got to be a tourist while I worked.&nbsp; Being out of the Philadelphia area really agreed with us.&nbsp; Philly is a great town, but so insular and stifling.&nbsp; I think we need to move, just not sure where yet.&nbsp; If I could find a 3-6 month stint overseas, we would leap at it.
