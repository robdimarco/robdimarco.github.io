So I was watching what was happening on one of my Linux boxes the other day using [top](http://linux.die.net/man/1/top). I meant to quit using Ctrl-c, but instead, I missed the control key and just hit &#8216;c&#8217;. To my wonder, the list changed and now I could see the full command line for each process. How crazy useful and how did I not know about this until now?
