Much has been made about [Yahoo and Google&#8217;s attempts at next generation social networks](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/08/google-yahoo-both-working-on-next-generation-social-networks/).&nbsp; In addition, companies like News Corp and NBC/Universal are trying to build a [YouTube competitor](http://battellemedia.com/archives/003778.php).&nbsp; Despite having good funding sources, I&#8217;m pretty skeptical about these companies (especially the News Corp/NBC video site) ability to create a truly popular and innovative social network.

First, you have the [Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FInnovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business-Essentials%2Fdp%2F0060521996&ei=O76SRqn_LKTMeOnx1MkK&usg=AFQjCNFPhK2S5md4XrpYVUNyb38XnuyOMA&sig2=4PxVotDSp5pjIih8DV4bpw) (any current or potential entrepreneur NEEDS to read this book)&nbsp;problem; big companies are great at producing evolutionary improvements to technology, but have a really, really hard time creating innovative products.&nbsp; This stems from a couple of factors including:

  1. **Great Expectations&nbsp;Lead to a Fear of Failure**&#8212; Google is expected to release great products.&nbsp; If they try to release an innovative social network and it bombs, just think of the newspaper headlines.&nbsp; &#8220;A Real Google Bomb&#8221;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&#8220;Google Losing the Magic Touch&#8221;.&nbsp; Everything has to be damn near perfect before you can go into a public beta.&nbsp; Also, the application has to be comprehensive from day one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Myspace.com had the luxury of focusing on making a product useful for bands to self-promote before being a place for any idiot to create a site.&nbsp; Facebook.com could focus on making a place to try to scope out cute chicks before becoming a development platform.&nbsp; A Yahoo or Google would not have the luxury of having those growing pains.
  2. **Competing Priorities** &#8212; Think about the now famous [Peanut Butter Memo](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Fpublic%2Farticle%2FSB116379821933826657-0mbjXoHnQwDMFH_PVeb_jqe3Chk_20061125.html&ei=9r-SRtPGCKCUeOuUicIK&usg=AFQjCNG1HeU5AsWf-4r58TUztJ-uQDZIog&sig2=3bpt0LIX8Yj_7-amvwpEIw)&nbsp;at Yahoo.&nbsp; Even at a large company, there are only so many projects that can be a priority for development, marketing, corporate, and operations.&nbsp; To justify the investment costs across the company for a major new innovative product is often too risky.&nbsp; For the News Corp/NBC Universal video company, the competing priorities that the focus is trying to maintain a legacy business model (television sponsored by advertising) as opposed to a better user experience.
  3. **Legacy Systems** &#8212; Both Yahoo and Google have social networks already.&nbsp; How do they put something new out there without pissing off legacy customers?&nbsp; Very, very hard (maybe impossible) to do.
  4. **Bureaucracy&nbsp;** &#8212; At any company, the bigger it gets, the more approvals it takes to make any kind of product or release.&nbsp; These take time and make it harder to respond to customer needs.&nbsp; The impact when trying to build a community site is gigantic.&nbsp; Unless you can be nimble enough to quickly respond to the community, you may never reach critical mass.
  5. **Too Many Cooks** &#8212; I think this could be a huge issue for the News Corp./NBC Universal site, but it is a factor with any big company.&nbsp; When too many people feel that they need to add their input about product direction, it tends to slow down development cycles and reduce innovation potential.

If a next generation social network is to be built, my bet would be on Google/Yahoo acquiring it (a la YouTube) rather than building it themselves.
