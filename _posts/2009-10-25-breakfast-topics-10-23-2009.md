Went to breakfast with [@codeslinger](http://twitter.com/codeslinger), [@sfraser](http://twitter.com/sfraser), [@kyleburton](http://twitter.com/kyleburton), [@jonnytran](http://twitter.com/jonnytran), [@cashion](http://twitter.com/cashion) on Friday and here is what I remember discussing

  * [Unicorn](http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/unicorn/) &#8211; Rack HTTP server
  * [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/) and his books [Fooled by Randomness](http://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Chance-Markets/dp/1587990717) and [The Black Swan](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Impact-Highly-Improbable/dp/1400063515) as 
      * Related discussed [Benoit Mandelbrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_Mandelbrot)
  * A bunch of chat about [Google Wave](http://google.com/wave) and how it would have been received if it were built by a small startup rather than Google 
      * Led to discussion of Christensen&#8217;s [The Innovator&#8217;s Dillema](http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business-Essentials/dp/0060521996) as well Moore&#8217;s [Crossing the Chasm](http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0066620023)
  * Comparison of work/life in NYC vs. Philly
  * Professional poker playing

I&#8217;m sure there were more that I am forgetting now (shouldn&#8217;t have waited 48 hours to do it).&nbsp; Very worth getting up early ðŸ™‚
