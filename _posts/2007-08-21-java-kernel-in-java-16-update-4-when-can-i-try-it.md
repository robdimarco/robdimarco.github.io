A recent blog post let&#8217;s the world know that the [Java Kernel will be a part of JDK 6 Update 4](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/forax/archive/2007/08/java_kernel_in.html).&nbsp; There is not a lot of information around what this means outside of&nbsp;[Ethan Nicholas&#8217;s blog entry in May](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/enicholas/archive/2007/05/java_kernel_unm.html)&nbsp;and some of his earlier posts [describing the intent project](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/enicholas/archive/2006/09/java_browser_ed.html) and the official [announcement&nbsp;about&nbsp;the project](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/enicholas/archive/2007/05/announcing_the.html).&nbsp; Seems like a cool idea to shrink the default download size of the JRE, but it is hard to understand the impact of this.

This really irritates the hell out of me.&nbsp; How can there not be an easy to find example and demonstration of this functionality?&nbsp; Maybe I am just blind, but I could not find anything from Ethan&#8217;s blog pages or by searching Google where I could see examples and understand how the implementation works.&nbsp; Will there be tight coupling with [JavaFX](http://www.sun.com/software/javafx/index.jsp)?&nbsp; How significantly will it reduce start up times.&nbsp; Is this really such a minor feature it should be released in a JDK update rather than JDK 7?&nbsp; This announcement seems to create more questions than it answers.
