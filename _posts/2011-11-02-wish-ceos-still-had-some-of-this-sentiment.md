  "What the average man on the job wants is a good job and a feeling that as long as he does what is right he can keep it.&nbsp; If a man is to have this feeling&#8211;and he cannot do good work without it&#8211;then the company must be loyal to him.&nbsp; As a matter of sound business policy, it is just as necessary that the company be loyal to the employee as it is that the employee be loyal to the company"
