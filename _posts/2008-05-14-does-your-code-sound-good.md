About six months ago, I switched my work computer to a MacBook Pro.&nbsp; Today, I read a LifeHacker tip talking about [easily forgotten/not know about Mac features.](http://lifehacker.com/390226/top-10-things-you-forgot-your-mac-can-do) One that I had never heard of was using the _say_ command, a terminal command that will speak whatever text you send to it.

<pre>&gt; say Hello World # Will speak from</pre>

<pre>&gt; say -f /etc/hosts # Will read out your /etc/hosts file</pre>

Hmm&#8230;.I wonder how my code sounds.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of the development concept that your code shouldn&#8217;t need a ton of comments if it reads well.&nbsp; But how would it sound&#8230;

Turns out some Java code sounded pretty good.&nbsp; I could definitely visualize and understand the class as it was being read to me.&nbsp; But some Ruby code I was working on sounded terrible; I chalk it up to the lack of verbosity in the language.&nbsp;

Another interesting use of the command for me is for README files.&nbsp; I usually lack the patience to read a whole README file, but I have good retention of those things that I hear.&nbsp; So when I see a README file, I can now just have say read it aloud to me and I get the content as I dive into whatever I am doing!
