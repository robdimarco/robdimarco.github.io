Interesting article from fortune on why [talent is overrated](http://money.cnn.com/2008/10/21/magazines/fortune/talent_colvin.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2008102116).&nbsp; As a society, we tend to overvalue innate talent.&nbsp; However, most success comes from focused hard work rather than pure talent.&nbsp; Tiger Woods is great because of how focused he is on constantly improving his game.

As i talked about in [Effective Technology Teams](http://www.innovationontherun.com/effective-technology-teams-rule-1-no-chumps/), what someone knows is much less important than what they can learn.&nbsp; For further reading, I highly recommend the book [Mindset by Carol Dweck](http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/0345472322/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224768553&sr=1-1).&nbsp; Fascinating book that helped make this concept clear to me.
