Ever thought of working at a startup?&nbsp; Reading [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com) articles and wishing that you could be part of the fun?&nbsp; Wondering what information you need to make a decision?

When considering joining a startup, here are the questions that I want to satisfactorily answer before making a decision.

## Position Questions

  1. Will I be able to effectively partner with the other team members? 
      * Will I get along personally and professionally with the other team members? 
          * Do the other team members have complementary&nbsp;qualities to me or will we all be trying to fill the same?&nbsp; 
              * Can we develop a shared vision? 
                  * Can we disagree in a constructive manner? 
                      * How will I get started at the position?&nbsp; Would there be a trial period? 
                          * What will be my roles and responsibilities in the short, mid, and long term? 
                              * What will I be responsible for and what will other team members be responsible for? 
                                  * How much influence will I have over product and company direction? </ol>

                                  1. How will I be compensated?&nbsp; How much cash (both deferred and non-deferred), equity, and bonuses. 
                                      * Is the equity being offered fair for my position and the state of the company (take a look at this [hiring plan equity suggestion](http://www.venturehacks.com/articles/option-pool-shuffle#market) from [Venture Hacks](http://www.venturehacks.com/)) 
                                          * How many outstanding shares are there and how many have been dispensed?
