In the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com">Washington Post</a> today, <a target="_blank" href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/staff/email/david+ignatius/">David Ignatius</a> writes a piece titled _<a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/01/AR2007060102178.html">The Ideas Engine Needs a Tuneup</a>_ on the mismatch between risk taking technologists and the risk fearing federal government.&nbsp; The thesis of the article is that the federal government is no longer making risky investments such as the one&#8217;s that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.darpa.mil">DARPA</a>&nbsp;used to make&nbsp;in the 1960s and 1970s that led to innovations like the Internet.

From the article:

> _"His&nbsp;[Jim Heath, professor of chemistry at Cal Tech]&nbsp;work was funded a decade ago by DARPA, but several scientists here doubt the Pentagon agency would back such a blue-sky project today. "If you have a high-risk, high-yield idea, the best place to execute it is offshore," Heath said&#8230;"DARPA seems to be shifting to the NIH model &#8212; more near-term, more risk-averse," said Don Ingber, a professor of pathology at Harvard."_

Aren&#8217;t high-risk, high-yield ideas a much better fit for the venture capital community than for the Federal government.&nbsp; Why should we expect the government to be able to sift through thousands (possibly millions) of proposals to determine where very risky investments should be made.&nbsp; Investors, including traditional venture capitalists, private equity firms, and venture arms of established companies have shown how this investment should be done.&nbsp; In Q1 of 2007, there was almost $**_<a target="_blank" href="http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/070423/117877.html">7 Billion </a>_**of venture capital invested including $2.88 Billion in healthcare companies.

I really have to question whether there is a significant need for more Federal investment in risky technologies by the Federal government.&nbsp; First off, there does not a pressing need for capital in this area.&nbsp; The free market is working effectively, there are clear and measurable profits to be earned from these investments and I cannot see a need for further investment.&nbsp; Secondly, government agencies and politics are the WORST way to decide where capital should go.&nbsp; The government appropriations process is geared to minimize the risk of the government getting ripped off, NOT to meet the capital needs of an early-stage technology company.

By ignoring the role that venture capital, the author significantly&nbsp;misses a gigantic piece of the big picture around&nbsp;funding of innovative companies. &nbsp;I wish Mr. Ignatius had taken a different tack on tuning the ideas engine; perhaps analyzing how government investments should integrate with private investments, perhaps by providing funding for technologies with interesting social implications, but limited commercial attractiveness.
