After reading [Brad Feld&#8217;s Me.dium post](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2007/06/chief_architect.html), I took some time to play around with their Firefox plugin.&nbsp; Short version, they track what page your browser is on and graphically display other people that are viewing that site or similar sites.&nbsp; You can then chat (directly to friends or by &#8220;shoutout&#8221; to the public) with others that are looking at the same stuff.

The GUI is pretty slick.&nbsp; Very responsive and fast with an interesting view on showing your network.&nbsp; One of the designers talks about the thought that went into [conveying the complex information](http://me.dium.com/node/716).&nbsp; Kudos to the developers and designers.

However, I just did not feel comfortable talking with other people or having other people see my name associated with what I was reading.&nbsp; I felt it would be like if the librarian gave someone my reading list or if iTunes broadcast every song that I played (I hate to admit that I like the Dixie Chicks).

I use sites like del.icio.us to track my bookmarks and do not mind making things public, but it just felt a little too Big Brotherish for me.
