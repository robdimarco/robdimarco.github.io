Over the course of my career, I have been able to work with a variety of companies in a variety of industries as a worker bee, manager, and consultant.

In any rapidly&nbsp;growing organization, the rate limiting factor for growth can often be limitations on how fast you can find high quality people.&nbsp; Losing a good team member just makes this a little bit harder.&nbsp; If you are a manager, it is your PRIMARY responsibility to keep your team motivated.&nbsp; Remember, you have already read [Joel&#8217;s Guerrila Guide to Hiring](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html), you have great team players, now the key is to keep them.

So in the spirit of [Anti-Patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern), here is what not to do to keep your team intact drawing from my years of experience in the startup technology game.

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      <strong>Pattern Name</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      <strong>Description</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      Public Insult
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      The manager makes sure that their person is dressed down in a public setting.&nbsp; The more public and the smaller the employee feels the better.&nbsp; Classic anti-pattern.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      Everyone Else&nbsp;Knows
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      Drawing on the <em>Public Insult</em> pattern is this pattern where you insult someone in a public setting, but ensure that they are not there.&nbsp; If this can be done in a mixed group with the employees peers as well as other managers, even better.&nbsp; Bonus points if you can bring in a senior manager who does not know the employee you are criticizing, but now thinks they have an attitude problem.&nbsp; Added bonus points if the criticisms are about bad decisions the employee makes in their personal lives.

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      Thanks for Nothing
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      Never, under any circumstances, recognize the effort that goes into a task.&nbsp; When people say something is hard, it just means they are lazy and do not want to work.&nbsp; After a big release, make sure that you point out all of the bugs and features that you want with no regard for their current accomplishment
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      Cone of Irresponsibility
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      Although you demand Accountability (with a capital A) from all of your subordinates, make sure that it is impossible to ever get stuck with failure.&nbsp; If your team does not produce, it must be that you are understaffed or that someone is not performing.&nbsp; It could not be that their manager gave them an impossible task with no mentoring about how to get it done.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      Ignorance is Bliss
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      Why learn about the cause of a problem when you can just lash out.&nbsp; You are in management, its your job to SOLVE PROBLEMS by ordering your team what to do.&nbsp; Why hear out the intricate details of the problem.&nbsp; Just order them to fix it.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      Ridiculous Promotion
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      Put someone in a position that they have neither the experience, training, and/or desire to do.&nbsp; Do not explain to anyone, including the person in the new position, what you expect from them.&nbsp; When they fail to meet your expectations, use <em>Public Insult </em>and <em>Everyone Else Knows</em> anti-patterns to sabotage their credibility.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      The Amorphous Position
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      Hire people into positions with no real job description.&nbsp; Let them figure out what they should do.&nbsp; Best done if you hire multiple people in with different but similar sounding job titles.&nbsp; For example, you can hire a Project Manager, a Product Manager, and a Program Manager all at the same time and watch them fight it out to see who does what.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      Bait and Switch
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      Tell a candidate that they are applying&nbsp;for one&nbsp;position and then when they show up on their first day, put them in a completely different position in a different department.&nbsp; If they are young, naive, and/or well compensated, what does it matter if they hate their job?&nbsp; If hiring into a management position, tell them you expect phenomenal growth on their team and then cut their budget.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      King of the Hill
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      Make sure that everyone knows that you are the boss.&nbsp; Get a nicer chair, nicer furniture, nicer computer, God knows you&#8217;ve earned it.&nbsp; Couple this anti-pattern with the <em>Public Insult</em> to make sure no one gets too big for their britches.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="178">
      Random Hiring
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="637">
      Somewhat related to <em>The Amorphous Position </em>and the <em>Ridiculous Promotion</em>, make hiring decisions that do not make sense.&nbsp; Why bother with consensus as long as you (and maybe your boss) like a candidate, that&#8217;s good enough.&nbsp; You did not get to such a high ranking position without having a sixth sense for people&#8217;s nature.
    </td>

I&#8217;m sure that there are more I can come up with, but dwelling on Anti-Patterns for too long is unhealthy.

Side Note:&nbsp; Speaking of Anti-Patterns and losing good people, here is a great article on [Java Exception Handling Anti-Patterns](http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2006/04/06/exception-handling-antipatterns.html) from a developer who used to work for me and who I drove out :), [Tim McCune](http://www.linkedin.com/in/timmccune).
