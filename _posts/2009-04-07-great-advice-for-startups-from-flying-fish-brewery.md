Check out these [business lessons from Flying Fish brewery](http://www.flyingfish.com/fishtales/business1.cfm).&nbsp; The lessons learned for them are very pertinent for anyone starting out.&nbsp; I have said before that an early-stage technology entrepeneur has more in common with an entrepeneur opening up a 7-11 around the corner than they have in common with the problems Larry and Sergei at Google deal with.&nbsp; This article really brings home some of the key problems that any entrepeneur will have to deal with.

  * Investment funding
  * Finding customers
  * Distribution channels
  * Capital investment decisions

I&#8217;ve seen a lot of my startup clients make some of the same assumptions and mistakes that the Flying Fish people have.&nbsp; It is always interesting to me how some problems domains.
