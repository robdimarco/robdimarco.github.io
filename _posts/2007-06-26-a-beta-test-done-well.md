CNN is planning on releasing a new and improved website.&nbsp; Rather than just throwing a new site out there like USA Today attempted, they put a beta site out and really listened to the feedback from users before launching even [asking if they are getting it](http://behindthescenes.blogs.cnn.com/2007/06/18/are-we-getting-it/)&nbsp;and [taking timeout](http://behindthescenes.blogs.cnn.com/2007/06/26/dont-worry-well-be-back-soon/ "taking timeout")&nbsp;to respond to the feedback.

Kudos to them for taking the time to listen to their users.
