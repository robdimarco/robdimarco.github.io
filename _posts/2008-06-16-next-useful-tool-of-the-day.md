Just started using [Jash](http://www.billyreisinger.com/jash/) for debugging my JavaScript.&nbsp; It is a JavaScript shell that you can dynamically startup and directly execute JavaScript functions within another webpage.&nbsp; So when I am developing, I can try out new JavaScript or execute debug statements right in the page without having to edit server side code or reload.&nbsp; Very easy to use, zero install, very impressive tool.
