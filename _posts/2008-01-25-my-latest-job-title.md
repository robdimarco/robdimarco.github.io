Recently I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of different jobs:

  * President of my own company, 416 Software
  * Adjunct Professor for Penn State
  * Interim VP of Engineering for an unnamed startup doing cool things with email
  * Build/Release/JBoss Expert
  * General Software Consultant

but for my latest title&#8230;.

[Management Consultant](http://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/archive/2008/01/23/Ruining_Morale_HR_Anti_Patterns_Retention_Management.aspx).

Good to know someone takes my ranting seriously!
