Hello, my name is Rob Di Marco, nice to meet you.

I have spent most of the last decade guiding fast growing technology teams. Currently, I am working for a early stage internet startup and doing some part time work as a strategic technology consultant. Prior to this position, I was the VP of Technology for Health Market Science, responsible for defining the technology vision for HMS and then turning the vision into reality. Before that, I worked as the Software Development Group Manager for The Adrenaline Group, a software development consultancy based in Washington, D.C. Rob graduated from the University of Virginia with degrees in Physics and Chemistry.

In addition, Rob serves on the board of directors for the ARC of Montgomery County, specifically advising them on technology.

I take my running pretty seriously. I&#8217;ve run 13 marathons in 8 states since 2003. My last big race was the Great Eastern Endurance Run, a 50 KM race, in late September, 2007.&nbsp; I&#8217;m starting to train for triathalons now, we&#8217;ll see how it goes.
